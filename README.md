# DLrepo
This repo dives into deep learning 
Files here are written in python using the pytorch library
Its fun how fast this machines can learn

I recomend using google colab

If you have to follow it from your local machine
You have to have python+pytorch and the dependencies(numpy e.t.c.) installed

Jupyter notebooks over notepads!.

Happy coding!
